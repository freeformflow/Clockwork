The Free and Open Employee Scheduling Tool.

This app is intended to assist a business with scheduling employees.  The back-end houses a database that can store employee data (name, skills, availability, etc).  The front-end is divided into two sections.  (1) is designed to allow a user to manipulate the backend database, and (2) is an interface that builds a schedule for one week.  (2) is also intended to be able to use the back-end database to staff automatically.

Any auto-staffing algorithm must be able to respect employee skills, turn-around times, weekly work-hour constraints, and a fair balancing of hours among employees.
