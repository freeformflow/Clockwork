The Free and Open Employee Scheduling Tool.

This app is intended to assist a business with scheduling employees.  The back-end houses a database that can store employee data (name, skills, availability, etc).  The front-end is divided into two sections.  (1) is designed to allow a user to manipulate the backend database, and (2) is an interface that builds a schedule for one week.  (2) is also intended to be able to use the back-end database to staff automatically.

Any auto-staffing algorithm must be able to respect employee skills, turn-around times, weekly work-hour constraints, and a fair balancing of hours among employees.


Version 1 - A partially completed app built from JavaScript and PHP using a MySQL database.  It was designed with a specific business in mind, so it was more limited.  

Version 2 - (Active Development) A newer and better version of the app that is intended to be useful to more businesses.  Also, its back-end is built from Ruby on Rails, replacing the PHP codebase.
